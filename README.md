# IITC Plugin: Reverse Portal Marker

This plugin for IITC (Ingress Intel Total Conversion) adds functionality to place markers at the reverse positions of portals, taking into account the China map offset.

## Motivation

Many portals in China are affected by map offset issues. If you encounter a portal that doesn't seem to correspond to any real-world object, you can use this plugin to check if there's a matching object at the reverse offset position. This tool is particularly useful for:

- Verifying the actual location of portals in China
- Identifying potential errors in portal placement due to map offset
- Improving the accuracy of your gameplay in affected areas

By providing a simple way to visualize the reverse offset position, this plugin helps players navigate the unique challenges posed by map discrepancies in certain regions.

## Features

- Adds a "Add Reverse Marker" button to the portal details panel
- Calculates the reverse position of a portal based on the China-offset mapping rules
- Places a marker at the calculated reverse position on the map

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the IITC community for their invaluable resources and documentation
- Inspired by the "iitc-plugin-fix-googlemap-china-offset" plugin for handling China map offsets
